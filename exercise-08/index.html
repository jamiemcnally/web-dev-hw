    <p><img src="./images/sketch.jpg" alt="An image of my sketch/design for my webpage" title="Webpage Sketch" width="800" height="500"</p>
    <p>I wanted to keep my design really simple and user-friendly by keeping the navigation/heading constant on each page link - similar to UMs new style.
      It will be clean and straight to the point with nice photos to add to the visual element.</p>
