I decided to take this class because I have always been interested in learning more about website design, and hope to create my own website someday.

I already know that I will learn so much from this class, as I'm a total beginner, but I'm most excited to just learn a new skill.

I uploaded one of my favorite photos of myself. I use it as my profile picture for pretty much everything.
