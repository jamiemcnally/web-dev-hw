    <h1>All That Is Gold Does Not Glitter</h1>
      <h2>J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
      <hr>
    <p>All that is gold does not glitter,
      Not all those who wander are lost;
      The old that is strong does not wither,
      Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

      From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
      A light from the shadows shall spring;
      Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
      The crownless again shall be king.</p>
