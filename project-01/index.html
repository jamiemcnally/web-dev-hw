    <h1>All That Is Gold Does Not Glitter</h1>
      <h2>J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
      <hr>
    <p>All that is gold does not glitter,</p>
    <p>Not all those who wander are lost;</p>
    <p>The old that is strong does not wither,</p>
    <p>Deep roots are not reached by the frost.</p>

    <p>From the ashes a fire shall be woken,</p>
    <p>A light from the shadows shall spring;</p>
    <p>Renewed shall be blade that was broken,</p>
    <p>The crownless again shall be king.</p>
