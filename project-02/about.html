    <h1>Why Strawberry Lemonade?</h1>
    <p>Strawberry lemonade is one of my favorite summer drinks, and since the weather is finally warming up, I thought I'd share a simple recipe that everyone can make at home!</p>
    <p>I also thought it would be fun to incorporate the fun, bright colors of strawberry lemonade into my instructable design.</p>
    <p>My siblings and I used to always hold lemonade stands when we were growing up, so it always brings back good memories. :)</p>
