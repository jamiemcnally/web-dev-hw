      <li>While resting, make the filling by mixing the cream cheese, powdered sugar and milk in a bowl until smooth. Transfer to a piping bag and set aside until ready to fill.</li>
      <li>Let rest for <em>10 minutes</em>, or until cool before filling. Pipe the cream cheese mixture on the macron and sandwich with another one.</li>
